<p>Reproducing Vulnerabilities<br>Ranking Vulnerability Severity、<br>Common Vulnerability Scoring System</p>
<p>The CVSS system is on version 3.1 at the time of this writing, which breaks down vul‐<br>nerability scoring into a few important subsections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base—scoring the vulnerability itself</li>
<li>Temporal—scoring the severity of a vulnerability over time</li>
<li>Environmental—scoring a vulnerability based on the environment it exists in</li>
</ul>
<p>CVSS: Base Scoring<br>The CVSS v3.1 base scoring algorithm requires eight inputs (see Figure 21-2):</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack Vector (AV)</li>
<li>Attack Complexity (AC)</li>
<li>Privileges Required (PR)</li>
<li>User Interaction (UI)</li>
<li>Scope (S)</li>
<li>Confidentiality Impact (C)</li>
<li>Integrity Impact (I)</li>
<li>Availability Impact (A)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Attack Vector option</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attack Vector accepts Network, Adjacent, Local, and Physical options.<br>Each option describes the method by which an attacker can deliver the vulnera‐<br>bility payload. Network is the most severe, while physical is the least severe due<br>to increased difficulty of exploitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Attack Complexity option</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attack Complexity accepts two options, “low” or “high.” The Attack Complexity<br>input option refers to the difficulty of exploitation, which can be described as the<br>number of steps (recon, setup) required prior to delivering an exploit as well as<br>the number of variables outside of a hacker’s control.<br>An attack that could be repeated over and over again with no setup would be<br>“low,” while one that required a specific user to be logged in at a specific time and<br>on a specific page would be “high.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Privileges Required option</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Privileges Required describes the level of authorization a hacker needs to pull off<br>the attack: “none” (guest user), “low,” and “high.” A “high” privilege attack could<br>only be initiated by an admin, while “low” might refer to a normal user, and<br>“none” would be a guest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>User Interaction option</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The User Interaction option has only two potential inputs, “none” and “required.”<br>This option details if user interaction (clicking a link) is required for the attack to<br>be successful.<br>Scope option<br>Scope suggests the range of impact successful exploitation would have.<br>“Unchanged” scope refers to an attack that can only affect a local system, such as<br>an attack against a database affecting that database. “Changed” scope refers to<br>attacks that can spread outside of the functionality where the attack payload is<br>delivered, such as an attack against a database that can affect the operating sys‐<br>tem or file system as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Condentiality option</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Confidentiality takes one of three possible inputs: “none,” “low,” and “high.” Each<br>input suggests the type of data compromised based on its impact to the organiza‐<br>tion. The severity derived from confidentiality is likely based on your applica‐<br>tion’s business model, as some businesses (health care, for example) store much<br>more confidential data than others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Integrity option</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Integrity also takes one of three possible inputs: “none”, “low,” and “high.” The<br>“none” option refers to an attack that does not change application state, while<br>“low” changes some application state in limited scope, and “high” allows for the<br>changing of all or most application state. Application state is generally used when<br>referring to the data stored on a server, but could also be used in regard to local<br>client-side stores in a web application (local storage, session storage, indexedDB).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Availability option</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Availability takes one of three possible options: “none,” “low,” and “high.” It refers<br>to the availability of the application to legitimate users. This option is important<br>for DoS attacks that interrupt or stop the application from being used by legiti‐<br>mate users, or code execution attacks that intercept intended functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Entering each of these scores into the CVSS v3.1 algorithm will result in a number<br>between 0 and 10. This number is the severity score of the vulnerability, which can be<br>used for prioritizing resources and timelines for fixes. It can also help determine how<br>much risk your application is exposed to as a result of the vulnerability being<br>exploited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVSS scores can be mapped to other vulnerability scoring frameworks that don’t use<br>numerical scoring quite easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.1–4: Low severity</li>
<li>4.1–6.9: Medium severity</li>
<li>7–8.9: High severity</li>
<li>9+: Critical severity<br>By using the CVSS v3.1 algorithm, or one of the many web-based CVSS calculators,<br>you can begin scoring your found vulnerabilities in order to aid your organization in<br>prioritizing and resolving risk in an effective manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary<br>Vulnerability management is a combination of very important but particular tasks.<br>First, a vulnerability needs to be reproduced and documented by an engineer. This<br>allows an organization to be sure the report is valid, and also to understand if there is<br>deeper impact than originally reported. This process should also give insight into the<br>amount of effort required for resolving the vulnerability.<br>Next, a vulnerability should be scored based on some type of scoring system that<br>allows your organization to determine the risk that the vulnerability exposes your<br>application to. The scoring system used for this does not matter as much as its rele‐<br>vance to your business model and its ability to accurately predict the damage that<br>could be done to your application as a result of exploitation.<br>After properly reproducing and scoring a vulnerability (the “triage” step), a vulnera‐<br>bility must be resolved. Ideally, a vulnerability should be resolved with a proper fix<br>that spans the entire application surface area and is well tested to avoid edge cases.<br>When this is not possible, partial fixes should be deployed and additional bugs should<br>be filed detailing still-vulnerable surface area.<br>Finally, as each bug is resolved, a proper security regression test should be written so<br>that the bug cannot be accidentally reopened or reimplemented at a later date.<br>Successfully following these steps will dramatically reduce the risk your organization<br>is exposed to as vulnerabilities are found, and aid your organization in rapidly and<br>efficiently resolving vulnerabilities based on the potential damage they could have in<br>your organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CVSS: Temporal Scoring<br>Temporal scoring in CVSS is simple, but due to complicated wording it can sound<br>daunting. Temporal scores show you how well equipped your organization is to deal<br>with a vulnerability, given the state of the vulnerability at the time of reporting (see<br>Figure 21-3).<br>Figure 21-3. The CSRF temporal score scores a vulnerability based on the maturity of<br>security mechanisms in your codebase<br>The temporal score has three categories:<br>Exploitability<br>Accepts a value from “unproven” to “high.” This metric attempts to determine if a<br>reported vulnerability is simply a theory or proof of concept (something that<br>would require iteration to turn into an actual usable vulnerability), or if the vul‐<br>nerability can be deployed and used as is (working vulnerability).<br>Remediation Level<br>The Remediation Level takes a value suggesting the level of mitigations available.<br>A reported vulnerability with a working, tested fix being delivered would be a<br>“O” for “Official Fix,” while a vulnerability with no known solution would be a<br>“U” for “Fix Unavailable.”<br>Report Condence<br>The Report Confidence metric helps determine the quality of the vulnerability<br>report. A theoretical report with no reproduction code or understanding of how<br>230 | Chapter 21: Vulnerability Management<br>to begin the reproduction process would appear as an “Unknown” confidence,<br>while a well-written report with a reproduction and description would be a<br>“Confirmed” report confidence.<br>The temporal score follows the same scoring range (0–10) but instead of measuring<br>the vulnerability itself, it measures the mitigations in place and the quality and relia‐<br>bility of the vulnerability report.<br>CVSS: Environmental Scoring<br>CVSS environmental scores detail your particular environment (specific to your<br>application) in order to understand what data or operations would present the most<br>risk to your organization if a hacker were to exploit them (see Figure 21-4).<br>Figure 21-4. The CVSS environmental score measures a vulnerability based on the con‐<br>text (environment) in which it would be exploited<br>The environmental scoring algorithm takes all of the base score inputs, but scores<br>them in addition to three requirements that detail the importance of confidentiality,<br>integrity, and availability to your application.<br>The three new fields are as follows:<br>Condentiality Requirement<br>The level of confidentiality your application requires. Freely available public<br>applications may score lower, while applications with strict contractual require‐<br>ments (health care, government) would score higher.<br>Integrity Requirement<br>The impact of application state being changed by a hacker in your organization.<br>An application that generates test sandboxes that are designed to be thrown away<br>would score lower than an application that stores crucial corporate tax records.<br>Availability Requirement<br>The impact on the application as a result of downtime. An application expected<br>to be live 24/7 would be impacted more than an application with no uptime<br>promises.<br>Common Vulnerability Scoring System | 231<br>The environmental score scores a vulnerability relative to your application’s require‐<br>ments, while the base score scores a vulnerability by itself in a vacuum</p>
